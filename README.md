# Distributions-Testing
Files needed to run CMA on a local device

dowload cma.exe to your local device ;

It is an auto extracting .exe so it will disperse the files on your home machine ;

If you dont want to use your home machine for this im sure a test device can be provided;

It should create a shortcut 'CSO Surveys';

double-click the shortcut;

CMA should open;

You will be challenged for your login info (which will be provided);

Cases that have been distributed to you should appear in the viewer window of the CMA;
